# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Robotics student at the South Westphalia University of Applied Sciences, with a strong passion for building cool stuff â€” especially at the intersection of hardware and software. ðŸ¤–

In my free time, I love working on side projects that let me explore new technologies, automate things, or just solve problems for fun. Whether it's writing code, tinkering with microcontrollers, or experimenting with machine learning, I'm always looking to learn something new.

## ðŸš€ What I enjoy
- Robotics & automation
- Embedded systems
- Python, C++, and more
- Building tools and small apps
- Collaborating on open source

Feel free to check out my projects and connect!
